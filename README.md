# E-Commerce
This is an E-Commerce written in Python thanks to the Djando framework.
This project was created as an assignment for the [Harvard CS50 course](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-web-programming-python-and-javascript "Harvard CS50 course").

The site offers several features:
- Ability to create your own user profile
- Ability to create an auction by entering the title, a description, an image and the initial price. 
- Ability for other users to bid for the auction. Furthermore, users can save products in their own watchlist, with a dedicated page, and remove them if necessary. The creator of the auction can also close it, thus decreeing the winner.
- Possibility to add comments on the pages of the various products.
- Possibility to filter the available auctions according to the category of the product on sale.

For the purposes of the course, this project can be considered concluded, but nothing prevents it from being expanded in the future.

The idea is to better divide the project, dividing the various parts into different apps, improve their scalability and maintainability.
